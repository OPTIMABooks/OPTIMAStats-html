<a href="sec_data.html#sec_data_variables_type" class="permalink">¶</a><p id="p-84">Another way to classify data is based on the types of variables that are being measured. The type of a variable depends on what is being recorded. Consider the following example.</p>

They mail each household a questionnaire asking the residents to confirm their zip code, list the number of people who live in that household, and give the length of time that they have lived there. What are the variables in this study, and how do the measurements differ?</p>

<p id="p-86">The three variables in this multivariate set of data are: zip code, number of residents, and length of time in residence. The characteristics of these variables are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-56">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Zip Code.</span></h6>
<p id="p-87">While the values recorded are numbers (i.e. 99324, 49103, 92357, etc) they actually represent categories and not numerical values. Notice that it would make no sense to “average” two zip codes!</p>
</li>
<li id="li-57">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Number of Residents.</span></h6>
<p id="p-88">These values are numbers (i.e. 2 residents, 5 residents, 1 resident, etc) and they do actually represent numerical quantities. Notice that it does make sense to talk about the “average number of residents.” Also, note that the values that this variable can take on are all whole numbers. In particular, there are “gaps” between the values (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li id="li-58">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Length of Residence.</span></h6>
<p id="p-89">The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). These numbers do make sense in an average, and they also are different from the number of residents values because there is no space in between them.  In other words, if I've lived at my house for 0.9 years, and you've lived at yours for 1.0 years, then there is still room “in between” those two values for somebody who has lived that their residence for 0.97 years.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div></article></div>
<p id="p-90">This example helps point out the three types of variables that we will be studying. The first type, zip code, is an example of a variable that really yields non-numerical data. The values of such a variable represent categories into which the individuals can be grouped, or in other words a “quality” instead of a “quantity.”</p>

<a href="sec_data.html#sec_data_collecting_plans" class="permalink">¶</a><p id="p-154">Since it is important that we select a sample that represents the population we are studying, we need to be very careful when selecting a sample. We not only need to guard against accidentally designing a sample that does not represent the population, but also against unintentional bias in the way we collect our data. One of the best tools in guarding against such biased samples is randomness, and the simplest way to use randomness to collect a sample is to collect a <dfn class="terminology">simple random sample</dfn>.</p>

<p id="p-160">The key to solving this problem is deciding if using a particular method give each group of six students the same chance of being chosen.</p>

<li id="li-84"><p id="p-162">This method is not a simple random sample. To see this, suppose that Bob is sitting in row 1 and Mary in row 2.

Even if we manage to design a simple random sample, we still can not be certain that we will get a sample that is representative of the population we are studying. There are several alternative sampling techniques that can help us select a representative sample, and at the same time make it easier to select our sample. Each of these methods employs randomness. However, none of them will result in a true simple random sample.</p>

The first group will be watered and weeded as normal. The second group will be watered and weeded as well, but will in addition receive fertilizer every other day. The third group will be weeded as normal, but will receive twice as much water. Finally, the fourth group of radish seeds will be weeded as normal, receive fertilizer every other day, and get twice as much water. Nancy will record how long it takes each group of radish seeds to sprout. Is this an observational study or an experiment?</p>
