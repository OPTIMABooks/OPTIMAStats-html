<p>Next, note that the expected value is not a guarantee. The charity could sell 100 tickets, making $200, and then have four lucky people pull a red and gold ball and win $50 each. This wipes out their profits all together. That is not a likely scenario, but it could happen. All the expected value tells us is that the most likely outcome is that they make $0.60 per ticket (because we lost that much), so wind up with $60.00 in profit on 100 tickets sold.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_random-vars.html#li-733">in-context</a></span>
