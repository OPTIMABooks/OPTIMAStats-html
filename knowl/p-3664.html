<p>As we have stated, the \(F_\text{test}\) statistic measures how much of the variation within our samples can be attributed to difference between the treatments. The larger the value of this test statistic, the more variation there is between the populations, and the less likely it is that the means are all the same.  In order to make decisions based on this test statistic, we will need to know what distribution it comes from.</p>
