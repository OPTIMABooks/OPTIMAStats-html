<p>Once we have collected our data, we need to be able to understand it. Data in its raw form--a long list of values--is not very informative. In this section we will explore ways in which we can organize data in tables and describe the values using graphs. The graph we choose to use will depend on the data we are describing as well as other factors. Some of these factors are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Does our data come from a quantitative variable or a qualitative variable?</p></li>
<li><p>Is our data univariate or bivariate?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we want a "quick-and-dirty" graph we can sketch by hand, or will a computer be drawing the graph for us?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the data represent the value of a variable over time, or the value of a variable from many different subjects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">By answering these questions we will learn to choose and construct an appropriate graph to describe many different data sets. We will also learn to interpret these graphs as a preliminary step in analyzing our data.</p>
