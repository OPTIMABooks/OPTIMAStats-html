<p>Many people are either dismissive of statistics (after all, you can prove anything with statistics, right?) or find the topic intimidating. However, a good understanding of statistics will help us to answer real-world questions such as the ones below.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Candidate X has 47% support from the voting public with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Is it possible that candidate X is supported by a majority of voters?</p></li>
<li><p>Mark scored in the 84th percentile on his achievement test scores. How could you explain to Mark's parents what this means?</p></li>
<li><p>A nurse needs to compare the rate of absorption of a drug in men and women to detect any differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Sally needs to decide if the decline in sales in her small business is significant, or if it just a temporary fluctuation.</p></li>
</ul>
