<p>The problem with the above strategy is that the blue region, whose area is the probability we need to find, is not a simple region. That is, it is not a rectangle like was the case in the uniform distribution. It is not even a triangle, circle, or other object that we can easily find the area of. In fact, if we want to find the exact area of this region, we would need to make use of the following formula, in which \(\mu\) is the mean and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the variable \(X\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation*}
