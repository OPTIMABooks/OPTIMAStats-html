<p>Creating a graph like this any time we wish to conduct an ANOVA test would be involved and would require a lot of “guess-work” when analyzing it.  Instead, we use the mathematical computations mentioned earlier to create what is called an <dfn class="terminology">ANOVA table</dfn>.  While we won't go into the details of how each entry in the table is computed, it is important to understand what the entries represent and how they are related to each other.</p>
