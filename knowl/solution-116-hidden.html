<p>Our first thought might be to construct a table for this probability distribution similar to what we did in the last example.  The problem we run into is that there are an infinite number of possible values (or at least, very large considering we don't know how big the town is). So instead, we will construct a formula.</p>
<p>\(Y=y\) means that it took \(y\) attempts to find the first dog owner. So the first \(y-1\) people that we asked were not dog owners. The probability that a given person is not a dog owner is \(\frac{2}{3}\text{.}\) The last person we ask does have a dog, and that probability is \(\frac{1}{3}\text{.}\) This yields the formula:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P(Y=y) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{y-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
