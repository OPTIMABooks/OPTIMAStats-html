<li><p>First, the expected values does not need to be one of the possible values of \(Y\text{.}\) In the example above, there is no outcome in this random process that leads to us losing sixty cents. However, the expected value of -$0.60 tells us that on average, we will lose sixty cents on each game we play. This is similar to saying that the average American family has 2.2 children. No family actually has 2.2 children, but if you average it out, this is the number you come up with.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, note that the expected value is not a guarantee. The charity could sell 100 tickets, making $200, and then have four lucky people pull a red and gold ball and win $50 each. This wipes out their profits all together. That is not a likely scenario, but it could happen. All the expected value tells us is that the most likely outcome is that they make $0.60 per ticket (because we lost that much), so wind up with $60.00 in profit on 100 tickets sold.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, notice how the probability and the value of \(Y\) both play an important role in computing its expected value. If a value of \(Y\) is very large, but has a very low probability, it will contribute little to the expected value. A smaller value with a large probability may contribute a lot more. Both the value and its probability need to be considered when computing expected value.</p></li>
