<p>This distribution is actually an entire family of distributions, one for each possible sample size less than 30. It is called the <dfn class="terminology">student's t-distribution</dfn> because the author, who worked for a brewery, was not allowed to publish his results so as to keep these tools away from competing breweries. The author believed, however, that this information should be shared and so he published it under the pen-name “Student.”</p>
