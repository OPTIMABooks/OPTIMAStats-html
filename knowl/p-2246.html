<p>Which of these distributions would we call moundâ€“shaped? The one in the middle appears to be the most mound-shaped of the three. The other two are skewed either to the right or to the left. Note that the one in the middle has a probability of \(0.5\text{.}\) The binomial distribution looks the most like the normal distribution when \(p = 0.5\text{.}\) However, as \(n\) increases, the value of \(p\) becomes less important. Consider the distributions below with the same values of \(p\text{,}\) but with \(n = 80\text{.}\)</p>
