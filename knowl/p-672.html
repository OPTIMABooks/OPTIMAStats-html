<p>One problem with using the variance as a measure of spread is that the units are different from the units of the data set. For example, if we say that the mean number of children in a US household is 2.2 with a variance of 0.4, then the mean is in “children”.  That is, there are an average of 2.2 children in US households. The variance, however, has units “square children.” What does it mean to say that the number of children varies by 0.4 square children? To remedy that, we often take the square root of the variance to get a measure of spread that is in the same units as the mean.</p>
