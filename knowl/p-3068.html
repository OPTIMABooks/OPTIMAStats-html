<p>While we will spend more time on this later in the section, it should be noted here that the outcome of a hypothesis test will be one of two conclusions:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">“We reject the null hypothesis”.</span></h6>
<p>This means that the sample we found is very unlikely if the null hypothesis were indeed true, so we conclude that the null hypothesis can not be true. Note that because \(H_A\) is the opposite of \(H_0\text{,}\) we must therefore support the alternative hypothesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">“We fail to reject the null hypothesis”.</span></h6>
<p>Notice the wording. We do not say that we have proven the null hypothesis, or even that we support it. We are simply stating that the sample we found is consistent with the assumptions put forth in the null hypothesis. That means that we have found no support for the alternative hypothesis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
