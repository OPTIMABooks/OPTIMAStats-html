<body><article class="example example-like"><p>A certain line of tires is said to have an average lifespan of 60,000 miles or more. To test this claim, a consumer advocacy group collects data for a random sample of 160 different customers who purchased these tires and subsequently had them fail. They find that mean lifespan of tires in the sample was 58,952.1 miles with a standard deviation of 6,439.6 miles. If you conduct a hypothesis test at the \(\alpha = 0.05\) significance level and the tires really do last 60,000 miles or more, what type of error will be made?</p>
