<p>Each of the twenty confidence intervals depicted by the vertical bars is constructed by taking a sample from the population with parameter \(\theta\text{.}\)  Since these represent 95% confidence intervals, we would expect 95% of them (the blue ones) to contain the true population proportion, and 5% of them (the red one) to miss the true population proportion.  While it wouldn't always work out exactly this way in reality—with eactly one of twenty intervals missing the mean—this illustration gives us an idea what the 95% (or any other confidence level) means.</p>
