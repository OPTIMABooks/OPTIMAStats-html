Use the tree to help find the probability that the 1st marble was white given that the second is red.</p>

Branch B has a probability 3/6, branch R has a probability 2/6, and branch W has a probability 1/6.  Of of branch B, there are three branches: B with probability 2/5, R with probability 2/5, and W with probability 1/5.  Off of the initial branch R, there are also three branches: B with probability 3/5, R with probablyt 1/5, and W with probability 1/5.  Finally, off of the original branch W there are just two branches: B with probability 3/5 and W with probability 2/5."></div>
