<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The pastor of a large church wishes to know what proportion of his congregation would be interested in a new outreach opportunity. Since the church is so large, he decides to collect a sample by randomly selecting 25 of the 100 active small group classes and asking all members of those 25 classes if they would support the new outreach program.</p></li>
<li><p>A county judge wishes to determine how many of the defendants that she sees have a high-school diploma. In order to collect a sample from her docket, she has her clerk use the computer to randomly select 40 case numbers and then checks the educational background of those defendants.</p></li>
<li><p>Workers for a consumer survey corporation collect data at a local mall by selecting a strategic location and then randomly selecting one of the first 50 people who walk by to ask to take the survey. They then ask every 50th person who walks by to complete the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>A golf pro shop wants to determine the average amount of money spent by the average customer. They suspect that men spend more in the shop than women. They therefore divide their customers into two groups: men and women. They then randomly select 40 of the male and 35 of the female customers and examine their most recent purchase.</p></li>
