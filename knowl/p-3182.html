<p>At this point it is important to point out that a slight change in the wording of a problem can change the type of hypothesis test that we use. If <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_ht-means_hypotheses-left.html" title="Example 5.2.2: Stating Hypotheses for a Left-Tailed Test">Example 5.2.2</a> had said “more than 60,000 miles” instead of “at least 60,000 miles,” then we would have reversed the tails in our test, using the null hypothesis that \(\mu \leq 60,000\text{.}\) If you are conducting your own hypothesis test, you need to be careful how you phrase your questions so that you wind up rejecting, or failing to reject, the hypothesis you really want to investigate.</p>
