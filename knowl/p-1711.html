<p>In each case, we ask ourselves if the value we measure is a result of a random or deterministic process.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since your grandmother can be assumed to have the same height each time you measure her (within a set time-frame of course), this is a deterministic process. Thus, her height is <dfn class="terminology">not a random variable</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you randomly choose a grandmother to measure, you will get different grandmothers resulting in different heights. The underlying process is random and therefore, this is a <dfn class="terminology">random variable</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>Flipping a coin is by nature a random event. The number of heads could be anything from 0-10 in this process. Therefore, this variable is a <dfn class="terminology">random variable</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the coin has a heads on both sides, we know for certain that one head will appear. The process is deterministic, and therefore the variable is <dfn class="terminology">not random</dfn>.</p></li>
