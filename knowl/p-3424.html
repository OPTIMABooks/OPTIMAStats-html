<p>When dealing with means, however, we sometimes want a little more flexibility. Instead of saying that the mean of one population is larger than the mean of another, we may wish to say how much larger. For example, the statement “dogs live at least 5 years longer than cats.” can be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\mu_1 \gt \mu_2 + 5 \quad \text{ or }\quad \mu_1 - \mu_2 \gt 5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">To get this added flexibility, we state our null and alternative hypothesis in terms of some difference \(d_0\text{,}\) which would have been 5 in this example. If we are testing a claim that two means are equal to each other, we set \(d_0 = 0\text{.}\) In most of our tests, we will use \(d_0 = 0\text{.}\)</p>
