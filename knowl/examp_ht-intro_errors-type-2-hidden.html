<body><article class="example example-like"><p>In order to pass, a new school bond measure needs to get at least 60% support among voters. You collect a sample of 500 likely voters and find that 61% of them plan to vote for the bond. You conduct a hypothesis test at the \(\alpha = 0.10\) significance level and conclude that there is at least 60% support for the bond, and it will pass. However, come election day only 59% of voters vote for the bond and it fails. What type of error did you make?</p>
