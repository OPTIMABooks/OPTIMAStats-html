<p>A polling organization needs to construct a 95% confidence interval. They want to be sure that their margin of error is no more than 4%. How many individuals do they need to sample to make this happen? This is just one example of a common situation. Before we even start to collect data, we need to know how big a sample we should plan on gathering. Selecting too large of a sample will be expensive and time consuming. On the other hand if we pick too small of a sample, we will get a large margin of error, and may not even be able to use the normal distribution methods from this section.</p>
