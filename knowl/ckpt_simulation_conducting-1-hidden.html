<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Seventy-four employees at a firm with limited free parking participate in a “parking lottery” to receive one of 23 free parking spaces. Seventeen of those whose names were in the lottery were upper management. When all 17 of the upper management team were "randomly" selected to receive free parking, the other employees complained that the lottery had been rigged. Use a simulation to determine if their claim has merit.</p>
<p>You decide to conduct the simulation using the following random number table, assigning numbers 00-16 to the upper management individuals and 17-73 to the remaining employees. Numbers 74-99 are skipped, as are repeated numbers.</p>
