<p>To understand this term, suppose that we measured the variables “average driving speed” and “number of speeding tickets.” It would be reasonable to say that there is causation between these two variables. That is, driving faster causes one to get more speeding tickets. But it is possible that there is another variable affecting both your driving speed and number of tickets. Suppose, for example, that you drive a fancy red sports car. This is a potential example of a <dfn class="terminology">lurking variable</dfn>.</p>
