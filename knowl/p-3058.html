<p>The first step in conducting a hypothesis test is to figure out what we are hypothesizing. While this may seem obvious, it is often overlooked or thought to be “understood.” However we must be very careful that we explicitly state two hypotheses, called the <dfn class="terminology">null</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">alternative hypothesis</dfn>, before we begin a hypothesis test. This is done not only to ensure our own understanding, but also because the numbers used in these hypotheses will be needed in the next step of the hypothesis test.</p>
