<p>Just as we constructed confidence intervals for the difference between two population means or proportions in <a href="sec_ci-differences.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.4: Confidence Intervals for the Difference Between Means or Proportions">SectionÂ 4.4</a>,  we can also conduct hypothesis tests for the difference between two means or proportions. The most common tests for differences are tests which seek to determine if two population parameters are equal to each other (so their difference is zero) or if one is greater than the other (so their difference is greater than or less than zero). Consider the following tests.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Early childhood education researchers wish to determine if babies whose parents spend time reading to them will have more success in school than babies who are not read to. To test this claim, they select a sample of 100 high school seniors who were read to as infants and 100 seniors who were not read to as infants. The mean G.P.A. for those who were read to was found to be 2.46 with a standard deviation of 0.77. The mean G.P.A. for the students who were not read to was found to be 2.33 with a standard deviation of 0.86.</p></li>
<li><p>An independent senator believes that she has equal support among members of both the Republican and Democrat parties. To test this belief, she commissions a study in which 340 Republicans and 418 Democrats are polled. 138 of the Republicans and 157 of the Democrats are found to support the senator.</p></li>
