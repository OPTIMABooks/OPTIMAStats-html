<p>Consider the following situations, which will appear as examples later in the section.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A researcher believes that on average, adults can hold their breath longer than children. The research collects a sample of 80 adults and finds that the average time they can hold their breath is 72 seconds with a standard deviation of 4.9 seconds. He also collects a sample of 43 children and finds that the average time they can hold their breaths is 58 seconds, with a standard deviation of 12.1. Estimate the difference, \(\mu_1 - \mu_2\text{,}\) between the average time an adult can hold their breath and the average time a child can hold their breath.</p></li>
<li><p>A certain mathematics department wishes to estimate the difference between the proportion of students who pass calculus having had high school geometry, and those who pass without having high school geometry. 50 Students who have had high school geometry and took calculus are randomly selected, and it was found that 46 of them passed calculus. 37 students who did not have high school geometry before taking calculus were also selected, and only 32 of them were found to have passed calculus. Estimate the difference, \(p_1 - p_2\text{,}\) between the proportion of students with high school geometry who pass calculus and the proportion without high school geometry who pass calculus.</p></li>
