<p>First, the expected values does not need to be one of the possible values of \(Y\text{.}\) In the example above, there is no outcome in this random process that leads to us losing sixty cents. However, the expected value of -$0.60 tells us that on average, we will lose sixty cents on each game we play. This is similar to saying that the average American family has 2.2 children.
