<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Events in everyday life can be classified as dependent or independent using common sense and the notion of cause-and-effect.  For example,</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>You forget to put gas in your car, and the next day it won't start.</p></li>
<li><p>You toss salt over your shoulder for luck, buy a lottery ticket, and win $20.</p></li>
<li><p>You stay up all night playing games and sleep through a meeting the next day.</p></li>
<li><p>You miss paying the electricity bill and your lights and other electrical appliances stop working.</p></li>
<li><p>You speed through a school zone on Monday and don't get a ticket. You do the same thing on Tuesday and are pulled over and ticketed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Question: which of the pairs of events above are independent?</p>
