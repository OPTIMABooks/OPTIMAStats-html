<p>Note that the formula for \(t\) looks a lot like the the formula for the standard normal variable \(z\text{.}\) The main difference is that we are using \(s\text{,}\) the sample standard deviation, instead of \(\sigma\text{,}\) the population standard deviation. This is no longer just an “approximation,” which we could get away with in larger samples. This is now the exact value of \(t\text{.}\) So what does the distribution of \(t\) look like? Below is a graph of the normal distribution, along with the distribution of \(t\) for several different sample sizes.</p>
