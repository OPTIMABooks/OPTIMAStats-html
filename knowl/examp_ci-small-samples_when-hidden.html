<body><article class="example example-like"><p>For each of the situations below, determine what distribution we should use to construct a confidence interval: normal, t-distribution, or neither.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The proportion of a population with a given characteristic is to be approximated using a sample of 40 individuals, 12 of which have the desired characteristic.</p></li>
<li><p>A population mean is to be estimated using a sample of size 50. The standard deviation of the population is not known, and the population may not be normal.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between proportions in two independent populations is to be estimated, but only one individual in the second sample had the desired characteristic.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between two population means is to be estimated using samples of size 20 and 40. The population distributions are known to be normal.</p></li>
