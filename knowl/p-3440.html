<p>The test statistic for a difference between means measures how unusual the difference between our two sample means would be if the assumed difference from the null hypothesis is true. This measure of “unusualness” is again a z-score from the normal distribution. To find that z-score, we look at the difference between our observed difference and the assumed difference, and then divide that by the standard deviation for the difference between sample means. That mouth-full is represented symbolically below.</p>
