<p>We will assign each person in our group of 100 a two-digit number from 00 to 99. This means we will take groups of two digits from the table above, skipping over any repeating numbers since we don't want to pick the same “person” twice.</p>
<p>In order to select our six pairs of digits, we must first pick a starting point.  We'll do this by rolling a six-sided die (since there are six rows in the table).  Let's say this comes up with the number 3.  Then we will start at the beginning of the third row in the table.  The first six pairs of two-digit numbers from that row are \(89, 06, 42, 73, 08,\) and \(65\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Each of these numbers represents one of our people, and there are no repeats.  So the six people we will use in our sample are those assigned numbers 89, 6, 42, 73, 8, and 64.</p>
