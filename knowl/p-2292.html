<p>There is one final issue to address before we are ready to start approximating binomial probabilities with the normal distribution. This issue has to do with the fact that we are using a continuous probability density curve to approximate a discrete random variable. To see why this may be a problem, consider the following picture. Suppose that the binomial random variable \(X\) (shown by the bar) is being approximated using a normal random variable \(Y\) (shown by the curve).</p>
