<p>A web programmer has just finished writing an online book store website. She needs to determine if the site will be usable. There are two parts to this website. The public section will allow a general Internet user to search for and purchase books from the store. The second administrative section allows the five book store managers for whom the website is being written to enter the books they wish to sell and view customer orders.</p>
<p>To test the administrative side of the site, our web programmer randomly selects 50 people who rate their Internet skill level as “average” and asks them to upload a book information and view customer orders.</p>
<p>Question: Which of the following is an accurate statements?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The programmer has not defined the population that she wishes to study.</p></li>
<li><p>The programmer has used a census when she should be taking a sample.</p></li>
<li><p>The programmer is using a sample that does not represent the population.</p></li>
<li><p>The programmer is using a convenience sample.</p></li>
</ol>
