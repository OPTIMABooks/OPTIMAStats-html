<p>The following statements interpret the percentiles used above.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Johnny's height was in the 20th percentile, meaning that he was as tall or taller than 20% of newborns and as short or shorter than 80%. So relative to other newborns, he was fairly short.</p></li>
<li><p>Isabella scored in the 95th percentile, meaning that her score was as good or better than 95% of children who took this achievement test. Stated from the opposite perspective, only 5% of children scored as well or better than Isabella.</p></li>
