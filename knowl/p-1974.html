<p>The above example was not a binomial process because of the small population from which we are drawing our sample. In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_binomial_is-binomial-2.html" title="Example 3.2.24: Identifying Another Binomial Distribution">ExampleÂ 3.2.24</a>  the population was assumed to be large. Suppose that there were 10,000 people in the population and that 5,000 of them own trucks. When we pick our first individual for the sample, the probability they will own a truck is \(\frac{5000}{10000} = 0.5\text{.}\) If our first pick owned a truck, the probability the second individual will also own a truck is now \(\frac{4999}{9999} = 0.499995\text{.}\) While this is not \(0.5\text{,}\) it is extremely close. Because the population is so large, the probabilities did not change by very much at all. In fact, as we pick our 100 individuals, the probability of getting a person with a truck will stay very close to \(0.5\) no matter which people we select.</p>
