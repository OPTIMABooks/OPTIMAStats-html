<body><article class="example example-like"><p>In order to be profitable, a bus route must have an average of at least 25 paying customers. We wish to decide if a certain route is profitable by collecting ridership information on 15 different occasions during a given month and conducting a hypothesis test at the \(\alpha = 0.05\) significance level.</p>
<p>After collecting your sample, you decide that the bus route is not profitable, even though the true average number of riders is 25. What type of error did you make, and what was its probability?</p>
