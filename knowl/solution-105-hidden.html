<li><p>Since we are told that the first marble was red, when drawing the second marble we have 9 marbles remaining, 6 of which are red. So, the probability the second marble is red is \(\frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>The probability that the first marble is red will be \(\frac{7}{10}\) since seven of the 10 marbles are red. In (a), we saw that the probability the second marble is red given that the first was red is \(\frac{2}{3}\text{.}\) Using the general multiplication rule, the probability that the first and second marbles are red is</p>

\begin{equation*}
P(\text{1st }R) \times P(\text{2nd }R\,|\,\text{1st }R) = \frac{7}{10} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{14}{30} = \frac{7}{15}\text{.}
