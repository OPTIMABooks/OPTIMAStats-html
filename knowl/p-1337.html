<p>The first rule says that because \(A\) is a subset of \(S\text{,}\) the ratio of \(n(A)\) to \(n(S)\) can be at most one, and as with any ratio, must be at least 0. The second rule tells us that the probability of something in the sample space happening is 1. Since the sample space contains all possible outcomes, this gives us the maximum possible probability of 1. The following Scale can be useful in judging how likely something is to happen based on its probability.</p>
