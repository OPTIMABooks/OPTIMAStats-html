<p>We may also wish to conduct a hypothesis test for the difference between population means when the sample from one or both of those populations is small, meaning less than 30. To do this, we must make one additional assumption. Just as was done when building confidence intervals for differences using small sample means, we must assume that the variances of the two populations are equal. Recall that this assumption lead us to use a <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_pooled-variance.html" title="Definition 4.5.19: Pooled Variance">pooled variance estimate</a>, given by:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
s^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(s_1\) is the standard deviation of the first sample of size \(n_1\) and \(s_2\) is the standard deviation of the second sample of size \(n_2\text{.}\) While we do not expect that \(s_1^2 = s_2^2\text{,}\) we do assume that they both will be close to the same common variance \(\sigma^2\text{,}\) and we therefore use \(\sigma^2 \approx s^2\) as our approximation in the following test statistic computation.</p>
