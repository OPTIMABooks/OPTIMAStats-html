<p>For many data sets the geometric mean and arithmetic mean are very close. But you wouldn't want to have your homework average computed using the geometric mean. To understand why not, think about what would happen if only one of your assignments was not turned in! In this text we will always use the arithmetic mean.  For that reason, we can simplify things by stating up front that we mean the <dfn class="terminology">arithmetic mean</dfn> when we say <dfn class="terminology">mean</dfn>.</p>
