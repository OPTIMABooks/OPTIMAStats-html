<body><article class="example example-like"><p>A scout leader claims that being a boyscout promotes character development and respect for the law. In fact, he claims that fewer than 10% of boys who spend at least one year in a boyscout troupe will get into trouble with the law before their 20th birthday. To test this claim, you take a random sample of 80 names from the rosters of boy-scout troupes fifteen years in the past and find that 11 of these former boyscouts have had trouble with the law. Conduct a traditional hypothesis test to test this claim at the \(\alpha = 0.10\) significance level.</p>
