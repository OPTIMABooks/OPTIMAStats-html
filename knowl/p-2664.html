<p>While this may seem obvious, there is some background knowledge that is important. In <a href="sec_sampling.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.5: Sampling Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem">SectionÂ 3.5</a> we saw that as long as the population was normal, or the sample size was at least 30, then the distribution of sample means, \(\overline{X}\text{,}\) will be approximately normal and have as its mean \(\mu_{\overline{x}}\) the population mean \(\mu\text{.}\) At this point, we don't need to know that the sample means have a normal distribution, although that will be important shortly. What is more important is that</p>

\begin{equation*}
\mu_{\overline{x}} = \mu\text{.}

<p data-braille="continuation">In other words, if we take the average of the sample means \(\overline{x}\) for all possible samples of a set size, that will equal the population mean. So \(\overline{x}\) is an <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_unbiased-estimator.html" title="Definition 4.1.4">unbiased estimator</a> for \(\mu\text{.}\)</p>
