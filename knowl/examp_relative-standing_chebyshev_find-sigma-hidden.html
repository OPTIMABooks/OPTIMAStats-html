<body><article class="example example-like"><p>The Matabolism rate of a drug is the rate at which the drug is eliminated from a patient's system. It is often measured in half-life, or the time it takes for 50% of the drug to be eliminated in the system.  Suppose that for a certain drug, the average half-life in a general patient is known to be \(\mu = 5.5\) hours.  A recent study found that in at least 99% of patients, the half-life was somewhere between 3.8 and 7.2 hours.  Use Chebyshev's inequality to determine the standard deviation of the drug half-life.</p>
