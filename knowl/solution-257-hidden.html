<p>In this case, the claim is that all three political parties are equally likely. If the probability of one of them is called \(x\text{,}\) then stating they are equal and recognizing that their probabilities have to sum to one gives us the following equation.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x + x + x = 1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If we solve that for \(x\text{,}\) we find that \(x = \frac{1}{3}\text{.}\) Thus, our null and alternative hypothesis should be:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
H_0\amp:\ p_R = p_D = p_I = \frac{1}{3}\\
H_A\amp:\ \text{The probabilities are not as described above}
\end{align*}
