<body><article class="example example-like"><p>A scout leader claims that being a boyscout promotes character development and respect for the law. In fact, he claims that fewer than 10% of boys who spend at least one year in a boyscout troupe will get into trouble with the law before their 20th birthday. To test this claim, you take a random sample of 80 names from the rosters of boyscout troupes fifteen years in the past and find that 11 of these former boyscouts have had trouble with the law. Conduct a p-value hypothesis test of this claim at the \(\alpha = 0.01\) significance level.</p>
