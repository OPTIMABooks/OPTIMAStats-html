<p>Also called a measure of variation, this number or set of numbers indicates how spread out the data is. For example, if three students take an exam and all score 80%, the average would be 80%, but there is no variation between the scores. But if three students scored 60%, 80%, and 100%, the average would still be 80%, but now there is a large amount of variation between their scoresâ€“they are much more spread out.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_center-spread.html#li-241">in-context</a></span>
