<p>Our mixed nuts example from the introduction has many of these same properties. However, the process of categorizing nuts is not binomial because each nut may fall into one of five different categories (peanut, hazelnut, etc). In a binomial process we are only allowed two possible categories: success and failure. Since our hypothesis tests for proportions are based on the assumption that we are dealing with a binomial process with only two outcomes, we need a new type of process that will work with problems such as the mixed nuts example.</p>
