<p>The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). These numbers do make sense in an average, and they also are different from the number of residents values because there is no space in between them.  In other words, if I've lived at my house for 0.9 years, and you've lived at yours for 1.0 years, then there is still room “in between” those two values for somebody who has lived that their residence for 0.97 years.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_data.html#li-58">in-context</a></span>
