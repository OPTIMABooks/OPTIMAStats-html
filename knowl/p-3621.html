<p>Because the Analysis of Variance test is a single hypothesis test, it uses a single null and alternative hypothesis involving the means of our populations. In an ANOVA test, the various populations are often referred to as the treatment groups. This is because the test was originally designed to test for differences between groups in an experiment that received differing treatments. The null hypothesis for an ANOVA test is that the different treatments all have the same mean. The alternative, is that at least one of those means is different. This is summarized below.</p>
