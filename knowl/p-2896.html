<p>The average reading speed, in words per minute, is to be measured among children in school districts designated as “low income” and school districts designated as “affluent.” A previous study suggests that the standard deviation of this reading score will be approximately 12 words per minute in the low income children, and 11.5 words per minute in the affluent children. A 99% confidence interval is to be constructed for the difference between the reading speeds of these two groups of children and a margin of error of 5 words per minute or less is desired.</p>
