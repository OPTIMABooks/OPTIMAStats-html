<p>The sampling techniques used are as follows.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The small group classes in this example are clusters. Since the pastor randomly selects several of these clusters and then questions every member of the class, this is a cluster sample.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case the judge is conducting a simple random sample. There is no special technique being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the worker in this situation is looking at every 50th person, this is a systematic sample.</p></li>
<li><p>The golf shop splits the population into two strata, men and women, and then randomly selects a few individuals from each of these strata. This is therefore a stratified sample.</p></li>
