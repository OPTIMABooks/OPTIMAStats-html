<p>To conduct an ANOVA test of the farmer's claim, the null hypothesis is that the average height found in all three groups of tomatos are the same. These three groups represent the three treatments—the different types of fertilizer. Thus, the null and alternative hypotheses are:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
H_0\amp:\ \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C\\
H_A\amp:\ \text{at least one group of plants has a different mean height}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Notice that the null hypothesis says that all three means are equal.  The opposite of that is not \(\mu_A \not= \mu_B \not=\mu_C\text{,}\) which says none of the means are equal.  If the mean height for fertilizaer A and B were the same, but C was different, the null hypothesis would still be false.  So we usually just state in words that “at least one of the means is different” instead of trying to write out our alternative hypothesis symbolically.</p>
