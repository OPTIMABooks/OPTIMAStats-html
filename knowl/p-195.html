<p>A sociologist wishes to measure the percent of traffic accidents that are at least partially caused by road rage. To collect his data, the researcher randomly selects 30 accidents involving motorcycles, 50 involving passenger trucks, and 100 involving passenger cars. He then questions witnesses to these accidents looking for evidence that road rage was involved.</p>
