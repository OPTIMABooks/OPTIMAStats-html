<p>Randomness is essential to the study of statistics for many different reasons.  Two of the most important are stated below.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>By using randomness we can design samples that have a better chance of being non-biased and representing the population.</p></li>
<li><p>By understanding randomness, we can use our sample not only to make a claim about a population, or estimate the value of a population parameter, but also to state how “good” that claim is.</p></li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Since inferential statistics, which is where we are headed in this text, is all about making claims about a population based on a sample, it is important that we understand randomness and more specifically, the probability of an event.</p>
