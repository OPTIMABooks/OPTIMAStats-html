<p>When dealing with discrete distributions and histograms, we were reminded of the special role that the area principle plays in probability graphs. That is, the area of a given bar in those graphs was exactly equal to the probability of the outcome associated with that bar. This principal holds true with continuous probability distributions as well. In the case of a continuous variable, however, we no longer have a histogram, but instead a smooth (and continuous for those of you who have seen Calculus) curve called a <dfn class="terminology">density curve</dfn>.</p>
