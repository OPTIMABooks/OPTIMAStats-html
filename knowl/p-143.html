<p>A web programmer has just finished writing an online book store website. She	needs to determine if the site will be usable. There are two parts to this website.	The public section will allow a general Internet user to search for and purchase books from the store. The second administrative section enables the five book	store managers for whom the website is being written to enter the books they wish to sell and view customer orders. To test the public side of the site, our web programmer randomly selects 50 people who claim their Internet skill level is “average” and asks them try out the public site and rate its usability. To test the administrative side, she has all five book store managers test the site and rate its usability.</p>
