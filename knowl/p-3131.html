<p>Notice that in the two examples above the results we found, either rejecting or failing to reject \(H_0\text{,}\) were the same as when we made our decision using a critical region and a traditional test.  That is not a coincidence! A p-value test and a traditional test will always give you the same results when conducted at the same significance level. The p-value test can, however, provide more information since the reader can see not only the final conclusion, but the actual probability of getting the sample that was collected.</p>
