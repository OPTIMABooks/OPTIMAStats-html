<body><article class="example example-like"><p>A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for the common cold. They claim that this drug shortens the duration of the cold in 80% of individuals. A physician believes that this proportion is inflated. He finds 115 individuals who have just developed a cold, administers the drugs, and observes that 89 of them recover more quickly than is typical. If you conduct a hypothesis test at the \(\alpha = 0.05\) significance level using this sample, and in actuality the drug is only effective in 75% of patients, what error will be made?</p>
