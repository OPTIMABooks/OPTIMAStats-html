<p>This is not an accurate representation of the store manager's frequency distribution. Notice that the 0-20 year old age group looks like it may be the largest group based on the amount of gray on the graph. It seems to be three times as large as the 61+ group in the back of the graph.  However, the 21-40 year old group is in fact the largest and the 61+ group is only about twice as large as the 0-20 year group. By adding the 3D effects, the store manager has violated the area principle.</p>
