<p>In each case we make a claim about a population and then gather a sample from that population to determine if our claim is reasonable. As we shall see, we do this in a very methodical way. For example, the 61% of voters who support the school bond in our sample will probably not be enough for us to claim with any level of statistical significance that the bond will pass.  A random sample of only 500 voters is likely to have a proportion supporting the bond that is one percent or more different from proportion of support in the entire population.</p>
