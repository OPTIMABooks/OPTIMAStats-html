<li><p>Salaries of all employees at a large firm such as IBM are likely to include outliers, such as the CEO's salary. For this reason, the median is probably the best measure of center.</p></li>
<li><p>The midrange may be best. This set of data should not include many outliers, and the values will be small and relatively close together. This makes the midrange an acceptable way to quickly measure the center.</p></li>
<li><p>Hair color is a qualitative variable, so our only choice is to use the mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Pine tree heights on an acre of forest land should not have large outliers, and there are likely to be quite a few trees. Since there is no reason to use any of the other measures of center, the mean would be best here.</p></li>
