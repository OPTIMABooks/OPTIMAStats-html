<p>Once we have computed the p-value of a test static, we then compare this probability to the significance level \(\alpha\text{.}\) If the p-value is less than \(\alpha\text{,}\) then our sample is less likely than our significance level, so we reject the null hypothesis. We have seen a sample that is too unusual for us to accept that the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is greater than \(\alpha\text{,}\) then we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Our sample is more likely than the significance level, so there is no reason to suspect that \(H_0\) is incorrect.</p>
