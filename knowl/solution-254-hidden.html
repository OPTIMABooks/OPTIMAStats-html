<p>Let's check to see if this process is multinomial by checking each property.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The process consists of a fixed number of identical trials.</span></h6>
<p>The trials are drawing a single nut from the container. There are a fixed number of trials because there are a fixed number of nuts in the container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The outcome of each trial is one of a set number of possibilities.</span></h6>
<p>In this case, there are five classifications of nuts. Thus, there are only five possible outcomes: peanut, hazelnut, cashew, brazil nut, or other type of nut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The probability of each category is fixed.</span></h6>
<p>although we don't yet know what it is (we want to test to see if it is 40% peanuts, 25% hazelnuts, etc), the probability of getting a nut of each type is fixed (assuming there are enough nuts in the population).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The trials are independent.</span></h6>
<p>If we consider the container of nuts we purchased to be a sample from the larger population of nuts. In this case, it is almost certain that the sample container is much smaller than (less than 5% of) the population of nuts in the packing facility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because each of the four properties is true, this is a multinomial process.</p>
