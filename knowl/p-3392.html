<p>A government official claims that 50% of cars on the road have under-inflated tires, and are therefore getting less-than-optimal gas  mileage. To test this claim, a random sample of 600 cars is selected and 279 of them are found to have under-inflated tires. If a hypothesis test is conducted at the \(\alpha = 0.10\) significance level to test the government officials claim, and the true proportion of cars with under-inflated tires actually is 0.50, what type of error has been made?</p>
