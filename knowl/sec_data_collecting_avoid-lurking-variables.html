<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Lurking Variables.</span></h5>
<p>One of the most prevalent things to avoid when using statistics is assuming that because there is a <dfn class="terminology">correlation</dfn> between two things, one must cause the other. In many cases there can be a third (or forth, or fifth) unknown variable that “lurks” in the background and is affecting both observed variables. Let's define these terms precisely and finish with an example.</p>

<p>We say that there is <dfn class="terminology">correlation</dfn> between two (or more) variables if certain values of one frequently appear together with certain values of the other.</p></article><p>For example, we would say that there is a correlation between people's height and weight because taller people tend to weigh more. But does being taller cause you to weigh more, or do they just go together?</p>

<p>We say that there is <dfn class="terminology">causation</dfn> between two variables if the value of one of the variables causes the value of the other to change.</p></article><p>To understand this term, suppose that we measured the variables “average driving speed” and “number of speeding tickets.” It would be reasonable to say that there is causation between these two variables. That is, driving faster causes one to get more speeding tickets. But it is possible that there is another variable affecting both your driving speed and number of tickets. Suppose, for example, that you drive a fancy red sports car. This is a potential example of a <dfn class="terminology">lurking variable</dfn>.</p>

<p>A lurking variable is an unmeasured variable that has an important effect on the relationship between variables in a study.</p></article><p>Consider the following examples.</p>
