<p>We have assumed in this section that each outcome is equally likely. In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_probability_measure_urn.html" title="Example 2.3.15: Assigning Probabilities to Outcomes">ExampleÂ 2.3.15</a> we pulled colored marbles from an urn in which each marble was equally likely, but not each color. This was because there were more marbles of some colors than others. In this example, we start to see how counting can be an important tool for computing probabilities.</p>
