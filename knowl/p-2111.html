<p>Based on the distributions above, there are two observations that can be made:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>It is clear that the average woman is shorter than the average man. Note that  he peak for women is at \(\mu_X = 63.6\) inches while for men it is at \(\mu_Y = 69.0\) inches. Graphically, this is represented by the fact that the peak of the blue curve is to the left of the peak of the red curve.</p></li>
<li><p>The variability in womens' heights is less than that in mens' heights. This can be seen either by observing that for women \(\sigma_X = 2.5\) is less than \(\sigma_Y = 2.8\) for men. Graphically, notice that the blue graph is taller and does not spread as wide as the red graph.</p></li>
