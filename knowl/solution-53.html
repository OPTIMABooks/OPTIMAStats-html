<p>We can no longer use the empirical rule, since we do not know if the distribution is mound shaped. Instead, we use Chebyshev's Inequality.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Our first step is to figure out how many standard deviations 82.9 and 122.1 are on either side of the mean.  This is the value of \(k\) in Chebyshev's inequality.  We compute that by finding the difference between the mean and the lower bound of our range and dividing by \(\sigma\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{\mu - \text{lower bound}}{\sigma} = \frac{102.5-82.9}{9.8} = 2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We could have found the same value using the upper bound.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{\text{upper bound} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{122.1-102.5}{9.8} = 2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Therefore, the percent of values in this range is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P \geq 1-\frac{1}{2^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\%
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that this is less than the 95% the empirical rule gave us. That is because we can not be as certain how the data is distributed if we don't know the shape of the distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the second part, we again start by finding the value of \(k\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{102.5 - 87.8}{9.8} = 1.5
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">So our range is 1.5 standard deviations on either side of the mean. Plugging this in we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P \geq 1-\frac{1}{(1.5)^2} = 1-\frac{1}{2.25} \approx 0.5556.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">So at least 55.6% of the data is within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean.</p>
<p>Note that this problem would not be possible with the empirical rule, even if we knew the distribution was mound shaped. 1.5 standard deviations is not one of the three options given by the empirical rule.</p>
