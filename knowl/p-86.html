<h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h6>
<p>The three variables in this multivariate set of data are: zip code, number of residents, and length of time in residence. The characteristics of these variables are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Zip Code.</span></h6>
<p>While the values recorded are numbers (i.e. 99324, 49103, 92357, etc) they actually represent categories and not numerical values. Notice that it would make no sense to “average” two zip codes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Number of Residents.</span></h6>
<p>These values are numbers (i.e. 2 residents, 5 residents, 1 resident, etc) and they do actually represent numerical quantities. Notice that it does make sense to talk about the “average number of residents.” Also, note that the values that this variable can take on are all whole numbers. In particular, there are “gaps” between the values (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Length of Residence.</span></h6>
<p>The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). These numbers do make sense in an average, and they also are different from the number of residents values because there is no space in between them.  In other words, if I've lived at my house for 0.9 years, and you've lived at yours for 1.0 years, then there is still room “in between” those two values for somebody who has lived that their residence for 0.97 years.</p>
</li>
