<p>So, for this example, we would have to look in the \(df = 4\) row and observe that the test statistic of \(2.316\) is between \(2.132\) and \(2.776\text{.}\) Therefore it's p-value is between \(0.05\) and \(0.025\text{,}\) the probabilities that are at the top of those two columns. Notice that the order changed because a larger test statistic will have a smaller p-value. So, we'll reorder this and state that the p-value is between 0.025 and 0.05.</p>
