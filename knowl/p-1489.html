<p>We start by counting the sample space, which will be the same for all three events. We are drawing three marbles from an urn containing 12 total marbles. We don't care about the order in which we draw the marbles, just the colors that are drawn. Therefore, \(n(S) = C(12,3) = 220\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since there are only two green marbles, it is impossible for all three of the marbles we draw to be green. Therefore, \(P(\text{all three are green}) = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>There are four white marbles. The number of ways we can draw three of the four is \(C(4,3) = 4\text{.}\) Therefore, \(P(\text{all three are white}) = \frac{4}{220} = \frac{1}{55}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>All three marbles can be the same color by being all green, all white, or all red. We said that \(P(\text{all green}) = 0\) and \(P(\text{all white}) = \frac{1}{55}\text{.}\) To determine the probability they are all red, we count \(n(\text{all three red}) = C(6,3) = 20\text{.}\) Thus, \(P(\text{all red}) = \frac{20}{220} = \frac{1}{11}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now since these are three different ways that we can get all three marbles to be the same color, and since each of these events is mutually exclusive (we can't get all three red and all three white), we use the general addition rule to get:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P(\text{all same color}) \amp = P(\text{all green}) + P(\text{all white}) + P(\text{all red} )\\
\amp = 0 + \frac{4}{220} + \frac{20}{220} = \frac{24}{220}\\
\amp = \frac{6}{55}.
\end{align*}
