<p>In the above example, note that had we been using the \(0.01\) significance level, we would have failed to reject the null hypothesis. This is because our p-value of \(0.0192\) is greater than \(0.01\text{.}\) This shows one advantage of a p-value test. By reporting the p-value, the reader can see that, while the null hypothesis may have been rejected at this significance level, at others it may not have been rejected. This allows the reader to make a decision for themselves as to how significant a test they would like to conduct.</p>
