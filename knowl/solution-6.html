<p>The key to solving this problem is deciding if using a particular method give each group of six students the same chance of being chosen.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>This method is a simple random sample. Each group of six students has the same chance of being chosen (we'll see how to compute this when we study probability).</p></li>
<li><p>This method is not a simple random sample. To see this, suppose that Bob is sitting in row 1 and Mary in row 2. Then it is impossible for Bob and Mary to be chosen in the same sample. This means that any group including both Bob and Mary has no chance of being chosen, and therefore all groups of six are not equally likely.</p></li>
