<p>We again verify the four characteristics of a binomial process.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>There are 100 individuals who are asked if they own are truck. They will either answer “yes” or “no”, so this is a binomial process with \(n = 100\) trials.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not know what the probability of a success is, but since the population is large, it is safe to assume that \(p\) will not change as we ask each person (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>How one person answers is not affected by how another person answers the question. Therefore the trials are independent.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, the random variable \(Y\) is the number of successes (people who had a truck).</p></li>
</ol>
<p data-braille="continuation">Therefore this is a binomial process and \(Y\) is a binomial random variable.</p>
