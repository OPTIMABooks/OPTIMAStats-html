<p>Consider the following situations in which this becomes a problem.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>You wish to estimate the average amount of iron contained in one cubic inch of moon rock. Because of the rarity of moon rocks, you are only able to get a sample of 6 rocks to test. You can, however, assume that the amount of iron follows a normal distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>A widget manufacturer wishes to estimate the difference between the lifespan of a basic widget and the lifespan of a deluxe widget. Because this test destroys the widget, and widgets are expensive, they must use a small sample of 14 of each type of widget. The lifespan of a widget is known to follow a normal distribution.</p></li>
