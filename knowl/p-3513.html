<p>When constructing confidence intervals in chapter 4, we saw that if the sample size was less than 30, we could not assume that the sampling distribution for \(\overline{x}\) was normal with a standard deviation of \(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\text{.}\) This required us to introduce the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_student-t-distribution.html" title="Definition 4.5.1">student's t-distribution</a> in order to work with smaller samples. The same is true when conducting hypothesis tests. Consider the following examples.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>You believe that the average lifespan of a supernova is 74 days. Because supernovas are so rare (approximately one every 50 years in our galaxy), you can only find accurate records from 7 supernovas to use in your data. Their average lifespan was 63.8 days with a standard deviation of 12.6 days.</p></li>
<li><p>You believe that moon rocks contain less iron than do earth rocks. To test this hypothesis, you collect a sample of 300 rocks from all over the earth and find that they contain an average of 6.7 grams per cubic inch of iron with a standard deviation of 2.9 grams per cubic inch. You only have access to six moon rocks, however, and find that they have an average of 2.4 grams per cubic inch with a standard deviation of 0.35 grams per cubic inch.</p></li>
