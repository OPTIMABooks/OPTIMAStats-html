<p>We start by drawing a graph of the density curve for \(X\text{.}\) Because the distribution is uniform, this means the curve will be a horizontal line above the range of possible values of \(X\text{,}\) which is from 5 to 10. Since the area under the curve must equal the probability and the probability that \(X\) is between 5 and 10 is 1 (this is the sample space because all possible values of \(X\) are between 5 and 10), we must make the height \(h\) the number for which \(h \times (10-5) = 1\text{.}\) That means, \(h \times 5 = 1\text{,}\) so \(h = \frac{1}{5}\text{.}\) This yields the first graph.</p>
