<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Nancy is more ambitions than Sam. She wants to know if radish seeds can be made to germinate faster by altering the conditions in which they grow. To test this theory, Nancy decides that she will plant four groups of radish seeds. The first group will be watered and weeded as normal. The second group will be watered and weeded as well, but will in addition receive fertilizer every other day. The third group will be weeded as normal, but will receive twice as much water. Finally, the fourth group of radish seeds will be weeded as normal, receive fertilizer every other day, and get twice as much water. Nancy will record how long it takes each group of radish seeds to sprout. Is this an observational study or an experiment?</p>
