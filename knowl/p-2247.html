<p>Notice that with the larger value of \(n\text{,}\) all three of these probability histograms look pretty mound shaped. Also notice that as \(n\) increases, the number of bars increases as well, and the distribution of probabilities starts to look less stair-stepped, and more like a smooth curve. Try playing with this yourself by performing the following steps.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Open the <a class="external" href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Java/Html/BinHist.htm" target="_blank">interactive binomial distribution page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the value of \(p\) (in the bottom right-hand corner) to several different percents to see what happens (for example, try 25, 50, and 75).</p></li>
<li><p>Change the value of \(n\) (in the bottom left-hand corner) to several different numbers to see what happens (for example, try \(n=10\text{,}\) \(30\text{,}\) \(50\text{,}\) and so on).</p></li>
<li><p>Try different combinations of \(n\) and \(p\) and notice how mound-shaped or skewed the distribution looks.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, click the “Show Normal Curve” button to see how the normal curve “fits” on top of the binomial probability histogram.</p></li>
</ol>
<p data-braille="continuation">Hopefully you have noticed that the larger \(n\) is and the closer \(p\) is to \(0.5\text{,}\) the less “gap” there is between the normal curve and the bars. That is, the less of the bar sticks up above, or does not reach up to the normal curve. The smaller this “gap” is, the better our approximation will be.</p>
