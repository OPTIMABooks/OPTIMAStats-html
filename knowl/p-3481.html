<p>An educator believes that the proportion of females in the US who have completed college is greater than the proportion of males. To test this claim, a sample of 600 women is randomly selected and 227 of them are found to have completed college. A sample of 570 men is randomly selected and only 192 of them are found to have completed college. Test this educator's claim using a traditional hypothesis test at the \(\alpha = 0.10\) significance level.</p>
