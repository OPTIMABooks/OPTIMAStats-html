<p>An urn contains 6 marbles: 4 blue and 2 red. Two marbles are drawn at random, without replacement, and the resulting colors are noted. Then, a single die is thrown and the number is noted. An example of an outcome in this experiment would be R-B-3 (1st marble was red, 2nd was blue, then a 3 was rolled). Consider the following events.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>\(A =\) the first marble drawn is red</p></li>
<li><p>\(B =\) both marbles drawn are red</p></li>
<li><p>\(C =\) the die roll is an even number</p></li>
<li><p>\(D =\) the sum of the number of red marbles drawn and the die roll is more than 2</p></li>
<li><p>\(E =\) the die rolls a 1</p></li>
</ul>
