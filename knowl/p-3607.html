<p>There is, however, a problem. In each of these hypothesis tests, there is a chance that we make the wrong decision. For example, suppose we used the \(\alpha = 0.05\) significance level on each test. The <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_probability-rule_complement.html" title="Theorem 2.3.29">complement rule</a> tells us that there is a \(1 - \alpha = 0.95\) probability that we will correctly identify equal means. But if we do this three times, using the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_probability-rule_general-multiplication.html" title="Theorem 2.4.26: General Multiplication Rule">multiplication rule</a>, the probability that we correctly identify all three means as equal is only</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(0.95)(0.95)(.95) = 0.8574\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The more means we add to this mix (suppose there were, for example, four fertilizers) the worse our chances become. The above is an example of how conducting multiple tests increases the probability that we make an error. To remedy this, we will introduce a way to check if multiple means are equal using a single test. This process is called an Analysis of Variance test, or <dfn class="terminology">ANOVA test</dfn> for short.</p>
