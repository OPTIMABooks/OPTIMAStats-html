<p>Making inferences about populations based on samples relies heavily on an understanding of how these samples behave. We must know what we can expect to see in samples that are drawn from a population with a uniform distribution, a normal distribution, or some other distribution. In the  previous subsection, we saw an example in which a sample drawn from a uniform distribution had sample means that had a more mound-shaped distribution. This is a particular instance of the next theorem.</p>
