<p>There are many assumptions that are made in simulating this example. Here are a few of the more important ones.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Each species of fish has the same chance of being caught--that is, no one fish is more likely to take a hook than another.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of fish does not change from those that we are given--no fish have died, been added, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The fisherman is fishing in a spot that is visited equally by all three types of fish--he hasn't found a place where trout will not go, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>And others...</p></li>
</ul>
