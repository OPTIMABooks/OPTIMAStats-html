<p>While we now have a good set of tools for estimating the value of a population mean, proportion, or differences between means and proportions, there are some times when we wish to make a decision instead of estimate a value. Consider the following situations.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>In order to be profitable, a bus route must have an average of at least 25 paying customers. We wish to decide if a certain route is profitable by collecting ridership information on 15 different occasions during a given month.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to pass, a new school bond measure needs to get at least 60% support among voters. You collect a sample of 500 likely voters and find that 61% of them plan to vote for the bond. Is this sufficient evidence to claim that the bond will pass on election day?</p></li>
<li><p>A researcher claims that men and women do not get the same number of hours of sleep a night. To test this claim, you take a sample of 250 men and 200 women and determine the number of hours of sleep that each individual in these samples gets.</p></li>
