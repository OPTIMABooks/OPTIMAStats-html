<p>In the tree diagram below, the labels represent the color of marble drawn. The fractions on the branches represent the probability of drawing that color marble at that stage in the experiment.</p>
<p>Now using this tree diagram, we find the desired probabilities.</p>

<li><p>Note that \(P(\text{2nd }W\,|\,\text{1st }R)\) can be read right off the tree. Since we are given that the first marble was red, we go across that middle \(R\) branch. Now, the probability the second is white is the probability on the \(W\) branch, so \(\frac{1}{5}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>There are two ways the 2nd marble can be white. If the 1st is red or if the 1st is blue. These are distinct (<a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_mutually-exclusive.html" title="Definition 2.2.8">mutually exclusive</a>) paths through the tree. The probability of each is found by multiplying down the branches.  Together, their probability is the sum of these two products, giving us:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P(\text{2nd }W) \amp = P(\text{1st }R\cap \text{2nd }W) + P(\text{1st }B\cap \text{2nd }W)\\
\amp = \left(\frac{2}{6}\times \frac{1}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{3}{6}\times \frac{1}{5}\right)\\
\amp = \frac{2}{30} + \frac{3}{30}\\
\amp = \frac{1}{6}\text{.}
