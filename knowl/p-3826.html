<p>To compute the test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test, our goal is to measure how far off our observed counts are from our expected counts. To do this, we want to examine the difference between observed and expected, but we don't care which is larger. Thus, we square that difference. Finally, we scale the difference by dividing by the expected counts. This is done because a difference of 10 means a lot more when only 15 were expected than it would if 100 were expected.</p>
