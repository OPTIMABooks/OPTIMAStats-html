<p>This formula should look familiar from <a href="sec_center-spread.html#sec_center-spread_mean-stdev" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.3.4: Mean and Standard Deviation">SubsectionÂ 1.3.4</a>. We restate it here, however, to consider a question. If we select a sample of \(n\) values and look at their average over and over again, will we see more or less variation between these averages than we would if we look at the individual values in the population? We shall see that there is in fact less variation between the means of different samples than between individual values. This is because it is a lot harder to get a group of \(n\) individuals who all vary in the same way from the population average than it is to get a single individual who varies from the population average.</p>
