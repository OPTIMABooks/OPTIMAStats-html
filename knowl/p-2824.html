<p>A researcher believes that on average, adults can hold their breath longer than children. The research collects a sample of 80 adults and finds that the average time they can hold their breath is 72 seconds with a standard deviation of 4.9 seconds. He also collects a sample of 43 children and finds that the average time they can hold their breath is 58 seconds, with a standard deviation of 12.1. What is the best point estimate for \(\mu_1 - \mu_2\text{,}\) the difference between the average time an adult can hold their breath and the average time a child can hold their breath?</p>
