<p>The union of the pies and the cakes in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_counting_addition-informal.html" title="Example 2.2.2: Using the Addition Rule">Example 2.2.2</a> above is the set of all 14 baked goods from which you can choose your prize. You may have also noticed that the word <em class="emphasis">both</em> was emphasized in the solution above. This is because it is important that when we use the addition rule, none of the choices be members of both groups—that is, none of the elements are in both sets.  Being in both sets \(A\) and \(B\) also has a mathematical name.</p>
