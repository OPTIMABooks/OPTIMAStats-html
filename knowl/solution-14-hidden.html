<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>The student is confusing causation and correlation. While there may be correlation between owning a television and having good nutrition, it is not logical to conclude that having a TV improves nutrition. It is much more reasonable to conclude that there is a lurking variable in this study. Perhaps the economic status of the families studied is causing both the differences in	nutrition and television ownership.</p></div></body>
