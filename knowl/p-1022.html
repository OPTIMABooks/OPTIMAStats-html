<p>A simulation is in some sense always wrong. We didn't actually fish in a lake stocked as the example stated. Add to that the fact that a random process will always turn out differently each time we do it, and you need to be cautious about claiming that “we must catch 6.4 fish” in order to complete the process.</p>

<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Model Outcomes Correctly.</span></h6>
<p>We must keep outcomes in the correct proportion to our random digits. Drop digits as necessary to ensure that these proportions are correct. If you have more than 10 outcomes to model, you can use two digits at a time.</p>

<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Run Enough Trials.</span></h6>
<p>The purpose of a simulation is to make a long and possibly expensive process short and cheap. So use a large number of trials!</p>
