<p>Once again, the problem we run into is that with each test, we increase the likelihood that we will make a mistake. Also, if we conduct these separate tests, we are treating the process as if it were binomial—with only two outcomes. In actuality, this process has five possible outcomes—the five types of nuts. In this section we will introduce a hypothesis test designed to check if a process with more than two  possible outcomes like this has a given distribution of probabilities. Because it is designed to check how well an observed set of outcomes fits a given list of probabilities, the test is called the <dfn class="terminology">goodness-of-fit test</dfn>.</p>
