<p>As was the case in the F-distribution, because we are always looking for large differences between observed and expected counts, we will reject the null hypothesis, which generates the expected counts, when we have large test statistics. Therefore, we will usually use right-tailed tests.  However, we can use left-tailed tests to look for observed and expected counts that match too well. The following examples allow us to practice looking up critical values using the table for members of the \(\chi^2\)-distribution family.</p>
