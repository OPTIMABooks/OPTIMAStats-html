<p>Notice that the 1000 in the second data set is a definite outlier. However, in computing the median, the actual value does not matter. The only thing that matters is its relationship to the rest of the data. This 1000 could be replaced by a more reasonable 220 and the median would not change. Bill Gates could make only $200,000 a year, and the median household income in Washington State would not change! This is what it means to be <em class="emphasis">resistant to outliers</em>.</p>
