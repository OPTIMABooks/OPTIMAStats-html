<p>A researcher believes that on average, adults can hold their breath longer than children. The research collects a sample of 80 adults and finds that the average time they can hold their breath is 72 seconds with a standard deviation of 4.9 seconds. He also collects a sample of 43 children and finds that the average time they can hold their breaths is 58 seconds, with a standard deviation of 12.1. What is the 95% margin of error for the estimate of \(\mu_1 - \mu_2\) given by the point estimate \(72 - 58 = 14\text{?}\)</p>
