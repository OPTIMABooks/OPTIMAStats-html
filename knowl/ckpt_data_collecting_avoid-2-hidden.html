<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>A major department store wishes to determine if people with store credit cards enjoy their shopping experience more than those who do not have store credit cards. To research this question, they send surveys to everybody who has shopped at their store in the last year and ask them if they enjoyed their shopping experience, and if they have a store card. They find that the majority of returned surveys are from people who either have a card and enjoyed their shopping experience, or from people who do not have a card and didn't enjoy their shopping experience. The store concludes that having a store card makes shopping with the store more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Question: Which of the “things to avoid” mentioned in this section did the department store do in its study?</p>
