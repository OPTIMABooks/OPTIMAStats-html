She decides that she will give A's on the final exam to those who scored in the top 10% of the class, and B's to those who scored in the top 25%. If the final exam scores had a normal distribution with mean \(\mu = 65.3\) and standard deviation \(\sigma = 11.6\text{,}\) What was the lowest score on the exam that earned an A, and what was the lowest score for a B?</p>
