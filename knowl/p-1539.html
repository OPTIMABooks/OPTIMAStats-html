<li><p>Does knowing if the first flip was a heads or tails change the probability that the third flip will be a heads? Coins do not have memories. Anything we know about the first flip has no effect on what happens on the second flip, so \(A\) and \(B\) are <dfn class="terminology">independent</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>This experiment is different. Knowing that the first flip came up a heads does have an effect on whether all three flips come up heads. After all, if \(A\) did not happen, then \(B\) can not possibly happen either. Therefore, \(A\) and \(B\) are <dfn class="terminology">dependent</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we are replacing the marbles after we draw them, the probability of getting a red on the first draw and on the second draw are the same: \(\frac{2}{3}\text{.}\) What happens on the first draw does not effect the probability of getting a red on the second draw. Because of this, \(A\) and \(B\) are <dfn class="terminology">independent</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>In our final question, we are again drawing marbles, but this time what happens on the first draw does make a difference. Since we do not replace the marbles we draw, if \(A\) does not happen (we draw red), there are two marbles left: 1 red and 1 white. So \(P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\) However, if \(A\) does happen (we draw a white), then there are two marbles left, both of which are red. So \(P(B) = 0\text{.}\) Since \(P(B)\) changes depending on whether \(A\) happens or not, \(A\) and \(B\) are <dfn class="terminology">dependent</dfn>.</p></li>
