<p>The advantage to having a standard normal distribution is that the areas which were hard to compute in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_normal_area-sketch.html" title="Example 3.3.24: Sketching Probablity in a Normal Distribution">ExampleÂ 3.3.24</a> can be computed ahead of time for this single normal distribution and compiled into a table. We can then look up probabilities in that table for regions in the standard normal distribution table. This table is called the standard normal table, and will be useful in many of the problems which follow. The example below shows a reproduction of this table along with an explanation of how to use it.</p>
