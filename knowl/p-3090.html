<p>This test statistic is the first step in determining if the sample we found is unusual. We must also have some guidance as to what the word “unusual” should mean. In this context, the term “unusual” refers to how likely we would be to see this test statistic for a sample if the null hypothesis is indeed true. We have seen this notion of how likely a sample is before. Recall that to construct a confidence interval, we need to pick a <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_confidence-level.html" title="Definition 4.1.18">confidence level</a>. If, for example, we decide to use the 95% confidence level, we are willing for our confidence interval to be “wrong” 5% of the time. In general, in a \((1-\alpha)100\%\) confidence interval, \(\alpha\) is the likelihood that our sample is unlikely enough that the confidence interval won't contain the true population parameter. When conducting hypothesis tests, this same \(\alpha\) has a special role.</p>
