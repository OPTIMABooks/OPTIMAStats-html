<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>An IRS agent believes that tax fraud is more prevalent on income tax returns where the gross adjusted income is more than $200,000. He takes a sample of 400 returns with income of less than $200,000 and finds that 12 of them are fraudulent. He also takes a sample of 300 returns with more than $200,000 reported income and finds that 15 of them are fraudulent.</p>
<p>Question: if those making under $200,000 are population 1, what should your alternative hypothesis be in this test?</p>
