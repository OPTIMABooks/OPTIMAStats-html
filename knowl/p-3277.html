<p>The second type of hypothesis test that we will study is the test for a population proportion. The following situations will provide the examples for this section.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for the common cold. They claim that this drug shortens the duration of the cold in 80% of individuals. A physician believes that this proportion is inflated. He finds 115 individuals who have just developed a cold, administers the drugs, and observes that 89 of them recover more quickly than is typical.</p></li>
<li><p>A government official claims that 50% of cars on the road have under-inflated tires, and are therefore getting less-than-optimal gas mileage. To test this claim, a random sample of 600 cars is selected and 279 of them are found to have under-inflated tires.</p></li>
<li><p>A scout leader claims that being a boyscout promotes character development and respect for the law. In fact, he claims that fewer than 10% of boys who spend at least one year in a boyscout troupe will get into trouble with the law before their 20th birthday. To test this claim, you take a random sample of 80 names from the rosters of boyscout troupes fifteen years in the past and find that 11 of these former boyscouts have had trouble with the law.</p></li>
