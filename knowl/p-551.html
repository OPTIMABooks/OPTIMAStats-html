<p>In this section, we will look at several types of numerical summaries, or measures, which we can compute from a set of quantitative data. These measures include both:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Measures of Center.</span></h6>
<p>A measure of center gives a single number that represents the "typical" value in the set of data. One very familiar measure of center is the average. When you say that the average score on an exam is 80%, you are claiming that the typical student scored 80%. This is not, however, the only way to measure the center of a data set, as we shall see in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Measures of Spread.</span></h6>
<p>Also called a measure of variation, this number or set of numbers indicates how spread out the data is. For example, if three students take an exam and all score 80%, the average would be 80%, but there is no variation between the scores. But if three students scored 60%, 80%, and 100%, the average would still be 80%, but now there is a large amount of variation between their scoresâ€“they are much more spread out.</p>
