<p>Seventy-four employees at a firm with limited free parking participate in a “parking lottery” to receive one of 23 free parking spaces. Seventeen of those whose names were in the lottery were upper management. When all 17 of the upper management team were "randomly" selected to receive free parking, the other employees complained that the lottery had been rigged. Use a simulation to determine if their claim has merit.</p>
