<p>Another type of probability, called <dfn class="terminology">subjective probability</dfn>, is basically just an educated guess of how likely an event is to occur based on one's previous experience. In this section we will learn about the basic rules and terms of probability, how to illustrate probabilities using pictures called <dfn class="terminology">Venn Diagrams</dfn>, how to compute probabilities of related events, and finally how to compute theoretical probabilities in experiments in which each outcome is equally likely.</p>
