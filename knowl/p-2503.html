<p>The failure rate of 11% is not very good if one wants to develop a reputation for being reliable. How could the polling organization lower the likelihood that they make a wrong prediction? As we shall see in the next chapter, one method is to recognize that there is the possibility of an “error” in sampling. Therefore, the pollsters should not predict a win based on a sample proportion of 0.60. Another method is to lower the variation between samples by raising the sample size. If \(n\) gets bigger, \(\sigma_{\hat p}\) gets smaller, and the probability of being wrong will go down.</p>
