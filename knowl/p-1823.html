<p>First, the expected values does not need to be one of the possible values of \(Y\text{.}\) In the example above, there is no outcome in this random process that leads to us losing sixty cents. However, the expected value of -$0.60 tells us that on average, we will lose sixty cents on each game we play. This is similar to saying that the average American family has 2.2 children. No family actually has 2.2 children, but if you average it out, this is the number you come up with.</p>
