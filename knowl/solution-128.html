<p>Let's review the four questions again.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>We are repeating the act of drawing a marble a fixed number of times (\(n = 5\)).</p></li>
<li><p>There are only two options, red or blue, and since we are counting the number of red marbles drawn, we will count drawing a red marble as a success.  On the first draw, the probability of a success is \(\frac{10}{20}\) since there are 10 red marbles.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the trials are <em class="emphasis">not independent</em> and the probabilities change. To see this, note that on the second draw the probability of a success is either \(\frac{9}{19}\text{,}\) if we drew a red on the first draw, or \(\frac{10}{19}\text{,}\) if we drew a blue marble on the first draw. So the probabilities change and the new probabilities depend on what happened on the previous draw.</p></li>
<li><p>Our random variable is the number of successes (red marbles).</p></li>
</ol>
<p data-braille="continuation">Because the probabilities change between trials and depend on what happend on previous trials, this process does not meet criteria 2 or 3.  It is therefore not a binomial process.</p>
