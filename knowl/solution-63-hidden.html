<p>We saw in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_simulation_conducting.html" title="Example 2.1.29: Conducting a Simulation">ExampleÂ 2.1.29</a> that the mean was \(\overline{x} = 6.4\) fish.  Using a calculator or spreadsheet program, we find that the standard deviation in this sample is  \(s = 4.2\) fish.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is almost as large as the mean, so there is a lot of variation in the number of fish needed to complete a trial. The 14's are not outliers, but they do have a z-score of \(z = \frac{14-6.4}{4.2} \approx 1.81\) which is relatively large.</p>
