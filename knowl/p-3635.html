<p>As we try to understand the variation in our data, observe the following from this illustration.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Each of the three groups overlaps—that is, the highest value in each group is larger than the lowest value in either of the other groups and the lowest value in each group is lower than the highest value in each of the others.</p></li>
<li><p>The overall mean of all twelve data points is relatively close to the individual means of each group.</p></li>
<li><p>If we measure the horizontal variation within each group and compare that to the variation between the means of the groups, we see that they are very similar—one is not clearly larger than the other.</p></li>
