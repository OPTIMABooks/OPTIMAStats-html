<p>A college student wishes to convince her fellow students that the cost of food in the cafeteria is too high. To do measure the effectiveness of several methods she shows a short video to one group of students, has a group discussion with another, and takes a third group out to lunch at the cafeteria. She then has each group respond to the question “does the cafeteria charge too much.”</p>
