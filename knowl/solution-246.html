<p>We have previously seen that the hypotheses are:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
H_0\amp:\ \mu = 74\\
H_A\amp:\ \mu \not= 74
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The test statistic is:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
t_{\text{test}} = \frac{63.8 - 74}{12.6/\sqrt{7}} \approx -2.142\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This test statistic has an absolute value between the entries \(1.943\) and \(2.447\) in the \(df = 7 - 1 = 6\) degrees of freedom row of the t-distribution table. Therefore, it lies between the critical values \(-2.447\) and \(-1.943\) on the negative side of the distribution. The probability of being further into the left-tail must therefore be somewhere between 0.025 and 0.050. Doubling these because this is a two-tailed test, the p-value for this test statistic is somewhere between 0.05 and 0.10.</p>
<p>We therefore will reject the null hypothesis at the \(\alpha = 0.10\) significance level, but fail to reject it at the 0.05 and 0.01 significance level. There is evidence <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table_significance-levels.html" title="Table 5.1.11: Common Significance Levels">tending towards significance</a> that the mean lifespan of a supernova is different from 74 days, but there is not statistically significant or highly significant evidence that the mean is different from 74 days.</p>
