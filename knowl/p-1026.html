<p>Seventy-four employees at a firm with limited free parking participate in a “parking lottery” to receive one of 23 free parking spaces. Seventeen of those whose names were in the lottery were upper management. When all 17 upper management employees were “randomly” selected to receive free parking, the other employees complained that the lottery had been rigged. You decide to use a random number table to simulate the situation. You assign the management employees numbers 00-16, the other employees numbers 17-73, and skip numbers 74-99. You then simulate a 10 trials using a random number table and find that on average 15.2 of the 17 upper management employees were selected. You therefore conclude that the lottery must be fair.</p>
