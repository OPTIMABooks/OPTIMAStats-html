<p>Recall the definition of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_theoretical-probability.html" title="Definition 2.3.2">theoretical probabilityÂ 2.3.2</a>. Using the rule given in that definition, we can now answer several more complicated probability questions. In the examples that follow, we will use several different counting rules to help us compute probabilities.  Notice how in each example we must first figure out which counting rule or rules to select and how to combine them to count the number of outcomes in both the sample space and in the event we which to find the probability of.</p>
