<p>Again we use a different symbol to represent the variance of a population, the Greek letter \(\sigma^2\) (pronounced “sig-muh squared”), and a sample, the Latin letter \(s^2\) (pronounced “s squared”). But the variance of a population also differs in a more substantial way from that of a sample. Notice that in a population, we divide the sum of the differences squared by \(n\text{,}\) the number of values in the population. But in a sample, we divide by \(n-1\text{.}\) This is an important distinction to remember. The reason for it is, unfortunately, beyond the scope of the course, but involves the fact that in a sample there is less variation than in the entire population.</p>
