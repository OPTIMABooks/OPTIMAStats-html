<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>If the two classes were <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_mutually-exclusive.html" title="Definition 2.2.8">mutually exclusive</a>, then we could use the addition rule to get \(23+34 = 57\)57 total people. However, doing this would double-count the 10 people who took both classes. To remedy this, we compute \(23+34-10=47\text{,}\) subtracting out those who were double-counted.</p></div></body>
