<p>Of course the larger \(n\times p\) and \(n\times q\) get, the better the approximation will be. However, the criteria above tells us when an approximation will be “good enough” for us to use. Notice that this criteria has nothing to do with the specific probability that we want to compute. It doesn't matter if we are looking for the probability that \(X\) is greater than a number, less than a number, or between two numbers. What matters is how large \(n\times p\) and \(n\times q\) are. This is because, as we saw on the last page, these two parameters control the shape of the binomial probability histogram, and this histogram is what either matches a normal distribution well or does not match well.</p>
