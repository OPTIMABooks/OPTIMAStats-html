<p>It turns out that in order to get critical values for the difference between two sample means, we have to make one more assumption. We have to assume that the two populations from which we are sampling have the same variance and therefore standard deviation, so \(\sigma_1^2\) and \(\sigma_2^2\) are the same. However when we draw samples we can not expect that they will come out with exactly the same variance. To get as accurate an estimate of what that single variance is, we must combine the variances of our two samples into a <dfn class="terminology">pooled variance</dfn> as shown below.</p>
