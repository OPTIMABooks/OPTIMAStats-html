<p>While the median is a good measure of center to use in the case where we know a set of data contains outliers, it does have one major disadvantage. Namely, it does not take the value of every data point into consideration. In many instances, we want each value in the data set to have weight in determining the “typical” value. To achieve this goal, we turn back to an already familiar measure of center, commonly called the <dfn class="terminology">average</dfn>.  We will, however, use a more precise name for this measure.</p>
