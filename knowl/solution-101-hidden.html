<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>When you choose door three, you are hoping that \(P(C) = 1\text{.}\) That is, you are hoping that even \(C\) definitely happens.  When the game show host reveals the goat behind door number two, he tells you that event \(B\) definitely did not happen. This changes the probability of event \(C\text{,}\) and as we saw in the video, you should switch to door number one.</p></div></body>
