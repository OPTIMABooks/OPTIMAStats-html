<p>Note that in this formula we are adding together the squares of the differences between each value of \(X\) and the mean of \(X\text{.}\) This definition is similar then to the definition of the variance of a sample or population as seen in <a href="sec_center-spread.html#sec_center-spread_mean-stdev" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.3.4: Mean and Standard Deviation">SubsectionÂ 1.3.4</a>. One big difference is that instead of dividing by \(n\) or \(n-1\text{,}\) we multiply each term by the probability that \(X\) will have that value. So in a sense, this is the weighted variance of \(X\) where each value is weighted by its probability. From the variance, it is relatively easy to compute the standard deviation.</p>
