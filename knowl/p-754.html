<p>If you think about the relationship between percentiles and quartiles, you may recognize that quartiles are in fact specific percentiles. The first quartile, \(Q_1\text{,}\) is also the 25th percentile. The median, \(Q_2\text{,}\) is the 50th percentile. And the third quartile, \(Q_3\text{,}\) is the 75th percentile. Percentiles are seen most often in conjunction with standardized measurements, such as an infants weight or standardized test results.</p>
