<li><p>This histogram has a single mode in the 15.1-20 class. The histogram is skewed to the left (that tail is longer) and the center appears to be somewhere between the 10.1-15 class and the 15.1-20 class.</p></li>
<li><p>Histogram (b) has two modes (bimodal). It is also skewed to the left, and the center appears to be again between the 10.1-15 and 15.1-20 classes.</p></li>
<li><p>This histogram is unimodal and symmetric. The center is in the 10.1-15 class.</p></li>
<li><p>Histogram (d) does not appear to have any modes--while some of the bars are taller than their neighbors, the difference is very small. We will call this histogram	uniform and	symmetric with the center right in the middle class, 10.1-15.</p></li>
<li><p>This histogram is bimodal and appears to be slightly skewed to the left. The center appears to be in the middle class.</p></li>
<li><p>Our final histogram is multimodal (three modes) and symmetric. The center is in the middle class, 10.1-15.</p></li>
