<p>In order to reach a conclusion in our hypothesis test, we need to compare the test statistic with the significance level.  However, the test statistic will typically be a z-score or t-score, while the significance level is a probability.  So we need to convert one or the other of them before we can compare them.  This can be done in two ways.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>We can convert our significance level to critical values and then compare the test statistic to those critical values. This is called a <dfn class="terminology">traditional hypothesis test</dfn>. This is the first method we will use.</p></li>
<li><p>We can find convert our test statistic to a probability by finding the probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as our test statistic and compare this to \(\alpha\text{.}\) This is called a <dfn class="terminology">p-value hypothesis test</dfn>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p data-braille="continuation">To conduct a traditional hypothesis test, we must divide the test statistic's distribution up into two regions. The <dfn class="terminology">rejection region</dfn> will be those values of the test statistic which are more unusual than the significance level, and will therefore lead to rejecting \(H_0\text{.}\) The <dfn class="terminology">acceptance region</dfn> is the rest of the distribution, containing those values of the test statistic which are not unusual. How we draw these regions depends on the alternative hypothesis being tested. In the pictures that follow, the red areas are the rejection regions and the blue areas are the acceptance regions. Note that \(\theta\) could be a mean or proportion.</p>
