<p>Both samples have the same mean, \(\overline x = 20\text{.}\)  So there would be no difference in their point estimates.  However, the variances in the samples are very different. Sample (a) suggests that the real population mean, while close to 20, could be quite different because the sample has such a large range. On the other hand, sample (b) suggests that the real population mean should be very close to 20 since the sample is not spread out very much.</p>
