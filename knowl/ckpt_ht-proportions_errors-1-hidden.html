<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>A self-proclaimed psychic claims that he can predict the flipping of a coin. To test his claim you flip a coin 120 times and have him attempt to predict the outcome. He successfully predicts 71 of the flips. Based on this sample, you perform a hypothesis test and conclude that the man does have skill in predicting coin flips.</p>
<p>Question: if in fact the probability the “psychic” can predict a coin flip is 0.5. What type of error have you made?</p>
