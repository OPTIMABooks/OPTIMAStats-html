<p>Also notice that the distribution of sample means has less variation than the distribution of individual values from the population. Another interesting thing that has happened is that the expected value of \(\overline X\) is \(6\text{,}\) which is exactly the population mean. That is, when we take the mean of the sample means, the average of the averages, we get the same thing as the mean of the entire population.</p>
