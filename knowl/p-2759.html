<p>One final note on the margin of error formula above. To use critical values, \(z_{\alpha/2}\text{,}\) from the standard normal distribution, we have to assume that \(n\times p\) and \(n\times q\) are greater than 5. Since we don't know \(p\)—after all, that is what we are trying to estimate, we again substitute \(\hat p\text{.}\) So we must make sure that \(n\times \hat p = x\) and \(n\times \hat q = n-x\) are both greater than 5 before we can use the formula above for margin of error.  In other words, we must have more than five “successes” and more than five “failures” in our sample in order to proceed.</p>
