<p>Stem-and-leaf plots are usually created by hand. Because of this, they are most useful for	relatively small data sets for which we wish to get a quick picture of the shape of the data. To get an accurate picture, it is important that each “leaf” take up the same amount of space. So if you are typing a stem-and-leaf plot into a computer, use a mono-spaced font such as courier so that the ones (1) don't take up less space than the eights (8). Consider the following	example.</p>
