<p>There are many situations in which we wish to repeat a string of identical Bernoulli processes and determine the number of times that we were successful.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>You take a 20 question multiple choice exam in which each question has 4 possible answers, only one of which is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>You survey 100 individuals from a large population asking them if they own a truck.</p></li>
<li><p>You examine a sample of 50 widgets taken from a production batch and determine how many of them are defective.</p></li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">What do each of these examples have in common? They are all examples of a <dfn class="terminology">binomial process</dfn> resulting in a <dfn class="terminology">binomial random variable</dfn>.</p>
