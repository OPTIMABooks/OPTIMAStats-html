<body><article class="example example-like"><p>A certain mathematics department wishes to estimate the difference between the proportion of students who pass calculus having had high school geometry, and those who pass without having high school geometry. 50 Students who have had high school geometry and took calculus are randomly selected, and it was found that 46 of them passed calculus. 37 students who did not have high school geometry before taking calculus were also selected, and only 32 of them were found to have passed calculus. Find the 99% margin of error in the estimate of \(p_1 - p_2\text{,}\) the difference between the proportion of students with high school geometry who pass calculus and the proportion without high school geometry who pass calculus.</p>
