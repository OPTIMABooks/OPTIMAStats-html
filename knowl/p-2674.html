<p>There are several things to note about this margin of error computation.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The distribution of the sample means must be normal. That means either the original population must have a normal distribution or we must have a sample size of at least 30 so that we can apply the central limit theorem.</p></li>
<li><p>We must know the value of \(\sigma\text{,}\) the population standard deviation. If we are trying to estimate the population mean, it seems unreasonable that we would already know \(\sigma\text{.}\) However, as long as our sample size is at least 30, we can use the sample standard deviation s as an approximation for \(\sigma\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">With these notes in mind, let's look at several examples.</p>
