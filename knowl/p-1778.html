<p>The area principle plays an important role in this histogram. Recall that the area principle states that the area of a bar in a histogram must accurately reflect the proportion of the class represented by that bar in the frequency distribution. In a probability histogram, this relationship is even stronger. The area of each bar must be equal to the probability of the value of \(X\) that it represents. Since each bar has a height equal to the probability and a width equal to one, this is indeed the case.</p>
