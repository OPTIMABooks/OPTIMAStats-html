<p>Computing the test statistic for an ANOVA test can, unfortunately, be somewhat involved. The basic idea is that we are going to compare the variation within treatment groups to the variation between treatment groups. This will allow us to determine how much of the overall variation in our data is due to the randomness of our samples, and how much is due to an actual difference between treatment means. While the mathematics of how these variations are computed is beyond the scope of this text, in the example below, we examine a graphical representation of these variations to help us understand what is being computed.</p>
