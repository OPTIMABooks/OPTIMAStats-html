<p>In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/examp_ci-intro_intro.html" title="Example 4.1.1: Motivating Estimation">ExampleÂ 4.1.1</a>, our goal was to estimate the speed of a pitcher's throw. What one measure computed from our sample of 40 throwing speeds would be best for this estimation? There are several possibilities including the mode, the mean, the median, or any other measure of center from this sample. However, which one is best? Which one will routinely give us an estimate that is close to the actual average? Such an estimator is called <dfn class="terminology">unbiased</dfn>.</p>
