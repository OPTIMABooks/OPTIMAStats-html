<p>Early childhood education researchers wish to determine if babies whose parents spend time reading to them will have more success in school than babies who are not read to. To test this claim, they select a sample of 100 high school seniors who were read to as infants and 100 seniors who were not read to as infants. The mean G.P.A. for those who were read to was found to be 2.46 with a standard deviation of 0.77. The mean G.P.A. for the students who were not read to was found to be 2.33 with a standard deviation of 0.86.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_ht-differences.html#li-1226">in-context</a></span>
