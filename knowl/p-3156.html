<p>In this section we will look at our first type of hypothesis testâ€”tests for single population means. Consider the following situations, with which we will work throughout the section.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A certain line of tires is said to have an average lifespan of 60,000 miles or more. To test this claim, a consumer advocacy group collects data for a random sample of 160 different customers who purchased these tires and subsequently had them fail. They find that mean lifespan of tires in the sample was 58,952.1 miles with a standard deviation of 6,439.6 miles.</p></li>
<li><p>An environmentalist claims that the level of mercury in a local stream has risen above the government mandated 2 parts per million (ppm). To test this, he collects 40 random samples of stream water and has them tested for mercury content. He finds that the average mercury content in these samples is 2.3 ppm with a standard deviation of 0.6 ppm.</p></li>
<li><p>A parts manufacturer has just set up a new production line to make gears with an average width of 8 centimeters. One of their customers complains that the gears being produced do not have an average width of 8 centimeters. To test this claim, the manufacturer takes a sample of 125 gears and finds that they have a mean width of 7.9 centimeters with a standard deviation of 0.88 centimeters.</p></li>
