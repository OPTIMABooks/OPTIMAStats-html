<p>Since “at most” includes the 2, we had to add together the probabilities of 0, 1, or 2 defective widgets. Be sure that you don't forget the possibility that there are 0 successes, or in this case 0 defective widgets! What if the question above had asked for the probability of at least 2 defective widgets? We could follow the same procedure, but the values of \(X\) that are at least 2 include \(2\text{,}\) \(3\text{,}\) \(4\text{,}\) \(\dots\text{,}\) \(20\text{.}\) That is 18 different probabilities to compute! Luckily, there is a short-cut. You can always use the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_probability-rule_complement.html" title="Theorem 2.3.29">complement rule</a> to ease in a computation such as this. The following example shows how this works.</p>
