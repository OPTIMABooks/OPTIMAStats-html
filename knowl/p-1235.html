<p>In the example above, we arrived at the final solution using two steps. First, we counted the number of ways to pick the friends to go with us if the order did matter, in this case it was 12. Then we counted the number of ways that those two friends could be arranged, which was 2. Finally, we divide the 12 ordered ways by the 2 different orderings to get a total of 6 ways to choose our two friends if the order does not matter. This process can be combined into a single counting rule called a combination.</p>
