<p>Since it is important that we select a sample that represents the population we are studying, we need to be very careful when selecting a sample. We not only need to guard against accidentally designing a sample that does not represent the population, but also against unintentional bias in the way we collect our data. One of the best tools in guarding against such biased samples is randomness, and the simplest way to use randomness to collect a sample is to collect a <dfn class="terminology">simple random sample</dfn>.</p>
